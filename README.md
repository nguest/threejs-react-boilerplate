## Fast

Fast is a WebGL car racing game-in-progress, built using three.js and custom shaders.

Tracks are created procedurally, from an array of curve points- computed from real lat/lon GPS coordinates if desired.

The interface will be React.js- currently only the game engine is operational. The aim is to ultimately create a Gran Turismo or Forza-like experience - but in the browser!

Visit the build-in-progress at [http://fastwebgl.herokuapp.com/](http://fastwebgl.herokuapp.com/). AWSD controls the car.

The story so far:

update! better trees, instanced track decals etc
